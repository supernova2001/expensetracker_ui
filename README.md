# Expeasy: AI powered Expense Tracker
Expeasy is a simple, easy to use expense tracker that helps users in achieving personal financial goals by effectively tracking and managing spendings. This platform comes with AI driven expense extraction, where expenses are automatically extracted from documents, invoices and bills using LangChain RAG model. Also, OpenAI is levaraged to provide users with suggestions around their monthly and yearly expenses. Below is the summary of features that are developed and are in progress:

Developed Features:

1. Dashboard to upload invoice/bill documents to extract expenses. The model basically extracts the total amount spent, the company or brand to which the amount is paid, mode of payment and date of spending.
2. Track Expenses module where the user gets insights around the monthly and yearly expenses comparing each month's and each year's expenses. It also comes with an option to ask questions around the expenses uploaded or added, to make it interactive and easy for the user to get to know about his/her spendings.
3. Financial Goals module where the user can set monthly spending goal and check if his/her spendings for a particular month are below the goal/limit set or are going beyond the limit.
4. Friends Zone: This module helps a user in managing group expenses. The user can send a request to a person who is available on the platform and start managing group expenses by creating a group.

Features under Development:

1. In the financial goals module, there will be a feature where the user earns points/coins based on the difference between the monthly spendings and goal set. If the difference is high, we can say that the user is well disciplined in terms of his spendings. The user can use these coins at the end of each month to unlock rewards and avail coupons with partnered brands.
2. Friends Zone group spendings module is yet to be completed.
3. A Financial assistant chatbot levaraging artificial intelligence and machine learning that helps the user in getting financial assistance and budget saving suggestions
